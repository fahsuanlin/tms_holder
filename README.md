# Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil holder for concurrent MRI and TMS
We present a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) holder for concurrent TMS-MRI studies. This holder features one-knob fixation to allow for high degrees of rotations and translation between the TMS coil at the distant end and the holder base at the proximal end via in-plane rotation and omni-direction rotation.

The current design is compatible with 3T MRI scanner from Siemens (Prisma).

**NOTE:** This invention has been filed for US/Canada patent.

#### A. The design of the TMS coil holder for TMS-MRI experiments. B.  The experimental setup of TMS-MRI with an MRI-compatible TMS coil, 8-channel MRI coil array, and coil holder. IPR: In-plane rotation joint. ODR: Omni-directional rotation joint. C. Three ways to place the TMS and MRI coils at the same locations and positions, illustrating the degree of freedom offered by the holder. D. An exemplary setup of two holders at the MRI. The empty Holder 2 can mount a TMS coil, MRI coil, supporting pad, or mirror.
