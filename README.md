# TMS holder
A TMS coil holder for concurrent MRI-TMS studies

We present a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) holder for concurrent TMS-MRI studies. This holder features one-knob fixation to allow for high degrees of rotations and translation between the TMS coil at the distant end and the holder base at the proximal end via in-plane rotation and omni-direction rotation.

The current design is compatible with 3T MRI scanner from Siemens (Prisma).
